Samba is a free open source software suit that enables file and print sharing between computers running windows and linux like operating systems.It implements the Server Message Block[SMB]
It is the standard protocol used by Windows for file and print sharing.
NTLM(NT LAN Manager) is an authentication protocol used by windows based clients to authenticate with samba sever.
Samba provides seamless integration
The samba server then verifies the users credentials against its user database which can be a local database or external authenticaation source such as LDAP or active directory   
Local database is typically stored in a file named "smbpasswd" located at /rtc/samba directory.
The file contains usernames,encrypted passwords and other information related to user accounts.
To find the ip address of the samba server  ifconfig or ip address command can be used.
Commands used by the window user to find the file shared by the samba server.
net use <drive letter>: \\samba-server\share/user:<username><password>
or we can use the below command
open run prompt by pressing win+r in keyboard and type samba server ip address.
Need of firewall:
It is the recommended to have a firewall enabled for local file sharing systems,even if the system is not directly connecte to the internet.
A firewall can help prevent this from happening by blocking unauthorized access to your network and monitoring network traffic for suspicious activity
